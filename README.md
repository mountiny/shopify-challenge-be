The Code Challenge for Shopify Backend Developer Intern position

### Stack

I have decided to use Strapi headless CMS for the backend part. This is an open-source CMS built upon Node.js. It can save me a lot of work with setting up the routes. I will upload and store the images in Cloudinary. This backend will be then deployed to Heroku.

For the frontend part, I chose to use Next.js in combination with TailwindCSS. i love this combination and it makes my development process feel so fast. I will deploy this to Vercel.

I have used Next.js + TailwindCSS started from Taylor Bryant to speed up the setting up process.
